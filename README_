Additional Features:
- An object selection tool
- View Rotation, controlled by dragging mouse on the view and the dials
- Zoom, controlled by scrolling mouse on the view or the slider

Each Object has a few parameters that can be modified using this tool:
- Rotation
- Scaling
- Initial Position

- Gravitation
- Restitution (Bouncing factor)
- Rotation speed
- Material coefficients (Diffuse, Specular & Specular exponent)

Each frame, the object's transformation matrix is updated and it's variables are updated.

Our paintGL flow is as follows:
- clear screen
- bind active shader program
- set projection, view and light uniforms
for each object:
  - update object transformation
  - bind vao
  - bind texture
  - set model & normal matrix and material uniform
  - draw object
signal objectsChanged (triggers update in mainwindow)
